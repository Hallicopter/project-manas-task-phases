November 30th: 
Finished KNN assignment from cs231n covering the following topics: 
> Find the  euclidean distance using one loop, two loops, and fully vectorised no loops
> Using euclidean distatnces to predict the class of a an image
> Using k-folds and cross entropy to find the best hyperparameter

December 2nd:
Done coding the gradient loss for SVM classifier.
> Coded in an unvectorised implementation
> Coded in a vectorised implementation
> Implemented stochastic gradient descent, for the SVM classifier
> Prediction and pushing the completed assignment will be done in the next commit.
