November 30th: 
Finished KNN assignment from cs231n covering the following topics: 
> Find the  euclidean distance using one loop, two loops, and fully vectorised no loops
> Using euclidean distatnces to predict the class of a an image
> Using k-folds and cross entropy to find the best hyperparameter

December 2nd:
Done coding the gradient loss for SVM classifier.
> Coded in an unvectorised implementation
> Coded in a vectorised implementation
> Implemented stochastic gradient descent, for the SVM classifier
> Prediction and pushing the completed assignment will be done in the next commit.

December 6th
Done creating the publisher to one topic, Will start work on lane detection and subscriber work.
Also done with the simple opencv stuff.
Will try and finish a majority of the ros and opencv task by this week.
I will get back to the machine learning bits a little later to mix things up.
